# MQTT tree & line protocol


## MQTT interface

All our systems will talk will talk fluently MQTT. MQTT is based on a 'publish & subscribe' mechanism.

### ESP32 - the controller
The controller needs to send data to our database & needs to receive commands from higher systems.

The input topic and I'm alive topic need to follow the line protocol so that these topics can be stored directly in the influxDB database.

**controllers/#macaddress#/input - line protocol**
The controller can publish on this topic

Example for a button message
```
controllers,id=D8F3A5A646FB button_name=1
```
Example for a diagnostic message
```
controllers,wifi_bssid=D8F3A5A646FB signal_strength=-50,battery_voltage=2.4,uptime=15530
```

**controllers/#macaddress#/output - json**

This JSON is to be decided by those who want to control the controllers. Good luck!
